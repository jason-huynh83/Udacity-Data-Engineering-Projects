# Data Engineering Nanodegree Program

## Introduction
In this program, I have learned to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets. 

## Projects
1. [Data Modelling with PostgreSQL](https://github.com/jason-huynh83/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Projects/tree/master/Data_Modeling_PostgreSQL)
	- Modeled user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify and created a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL I have also defined Fact and Dimension tables and inserted data into new tables.
