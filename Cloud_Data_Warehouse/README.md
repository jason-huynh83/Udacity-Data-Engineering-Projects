# Data Warehouse Project
## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Task is to build an ETL Pipeline that extracts their data from S3, staging it in Redshift and then transforming data into a set of Dimensional and Fact Tables for their Analytics Team to continue finding Insights to what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Description
Application of data warehouse and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. The data will need to be loaded from S3 to staging tables on Redshift. An ETL process is used from the staging tables to create Fact and Dimension tables where the analytics team are able to read from.  

## Datasets
- **Song Dataset**: The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. [Million Song Dataset.](http://millionsongdataset.com/) Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.
- **Log Dataset**: The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format and generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

## Data Schema and Design
### Fact Table
- **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong.
  - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
 
 ### Dimension Tables
 - **users** - users in the app
   - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
  - **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broekn down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
 - **artists** - artists in music database
   - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
  - **songs** - songs in the music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

## Setup
### Setup Configurations
- Create Redshift DB and ARN(IAM ROLE) from AWS
- Setup the dwh.cfg file
- Enter the following information from Redshift DB and ARN
~~~
[CLUSTER]
HOST=''
DB_NAME=''
DB_USER=''
DB_PASSWORD=''
DB_PORT= 

[IAM_ROLE]
ARN=''

[S3]
LOG_DATA='s3://udacity-dend/log_data'
LOG_JSONPATH='s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json'
SONG_DATA='s3://udacity-dend/song_data'

~~~

## Program Execution
- run **create_tables.py** to allow the database to be created and connected. This file will also create the necessary tables for the project.
- run **etl.py** to process the data in and process the ETL workflow
